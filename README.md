# FastmapVsPCA

Comparison of PCA (implemented in Matlab) with FASTMAP

FASTMAP – Christos Faloutsos’s implementation of FASTMAP in C
with some minor changes:
i) Increased maxlength of vector
ii) Keeping the transformed data and distances to be used for next
sub sections. 

Their performance can be analyzed in terms of Stress/Distortion/Response time etc with respect to dimention reduction.
